NOTICE
=========
Since Jun 4th 2018, Microsoft has acquired GitHub, therefore GNU Artanis will
never try to organize community on GitHub, include issues and PR. Please visit
https://gitlab.com/hardenedlinux/artanis

According to
[GNU Ethical Repository Criteria Evaluations](https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.html).
GNU Artanis as GNU official project is not proper to be maintained on GitHub.
So I **will not** do maintenance work for GNU Artanis on GitHub to show my
position on free software. That means I **will not** respond to issues or pull
requests on GitHub, until they show some respect to freedom of users on these
issues:
* No other nonfree software is required to use the site (thus, no Flash).
* Does not discriminate against classes of users, or against any country.

The maintenance repo will be these two:
* [GNU official repo](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/artanis.git/)
Accepts patches and issues on mailing-list artanis@gnu.org

* [GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/hardenedlinux/artanis)
Accepts issues and pull requests.

For historical reasons, GNU Artanis will maintain the site with gh-pages on
GitHub since the pages service on GitLab is very different so I can't just move
it simply. Before we have a better/modern Savannah, we have to endure this
situation.

GNU Artanis
=========

GNU Artanis aims to be a web application framework for Scheme. The philosophy of
Artanis is to be very radical, and to try cutting-edge things.  So use it at
your own risk...however, playing with it may result in some cool experiences!

## Features:

* GPLv3+ & LGPLv3+
* Very lightweight - easy to hack and learn for newbies.
* Support JSON/CSV/XML/SXML.
* A complete web-server implementation, including an error page handler.
* High concurrent async non-blocking server core based on delimited
continuations.
* Has a Sinatra-like style route, hence the name "Artanis" ;-)
* Supported databases (through guile-dbi): MySQL/SQLite/PostgreSQL.
* Nice and easy web cache control.
* Efficient HTML template parsing.
* Efficient static file downloading/uploading.

Thank you very much for contributing!

Bug reports are appreciated contributions. Please don't hesitate to report bugs
in a manner that allows them to be reproduced.

Please read the manual carefully, and ask questions to know more about GNU
Artanis. The preferred way to discuss internals of Artanis is to send mail to
[artanis@gnu.org](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/artanis) because it's
good for archive. And you could discuss the bugs in issues for better tracking
than mails.

I'll write articles about GNU Artanis occasionally on my blog:

GNU Artanis is aiming for production quality, since it's going to be used in a
real product. So we need high quality contributions.  Small and/or obvious fixes
are likely to be easily applied. Larger contributions should be discussed firstaduring the planning phase as they will require strict review.

Artwork and document are also important contributions and greatly appreciated bythe GNU Artanis community. Advocating on GNU Artanis on your blogs, wikis, and
webcast tutorials are good ways to help grow the GNU Artanis community.

If you're using GNU Artanis in your project, please share your experiences. GNU 
Artanis wants to be a friendly community to help people learn about free
software and increase use of functional programming in industry.
