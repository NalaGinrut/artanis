* theme (based on template)
* make own favicon.ico (now use opensuse ico instead)
* implement expand-conds for ssql
* write test-cases for ssql
* implement tpl cache, not read tpl file every time rendering
* design a generic session framework with optional store method: memcached/file+RCU/Berkerley DB...
* sql-mapping syntax should support multi-sql code, but should deal with SQL-injection
* upload progress json feedback (need new server-core)

* Implement co-operative server with delimited-continuation
** green-thread server
   This may need these stuffs:
   1. non-blocking;
   2. scheduling based on delimited-continuations;
   3. guile-dbi needs non-blocking too;
   4. enhanced connection pool;
   5. epoll/kqueue wrapper.
Some ideas:
** Format a patch to guile-dbi for supporting non-blocking. However, now that SQL-query can be blocked, we have to face the connection-pool problem.
   In current implementation, all green-threads works for the same CPU share the same connection from the pool. That's bad, since one of the thread
   can be scheduled-out in non-blocking mode, so the next scheduled-in thread should get a clean connection from the pool.
** Maybe there'd be a connection pool for each CPU, and a waiting queue to hold the EWOULDBLOCK dbi-connection. The connection could be recycled when
   each scheduled green-thread was over.

* Use sendfile on static files, this may need new server-core.

* Add FAM(File Alteration Monitor) based reload-on-the-fly mechanism to debug mode. `inotify' would be fine enough.
  ** Never use it in productive environment.
  ** Could be named 'hotfix-on-debug', and #:hotfix-on-debug should checkout if there's guile-inotify.

* In MySQL, delete huge data in product environment will cause halt. There're two ways:
  1. limit 1000 and loop
  2. use store procedure

* Security stratage:
  1. uri-decode should only be used in response processing, never request processing!
  2. Any string which will be sent into DBI shouldn't be uri-decode in advanced!
